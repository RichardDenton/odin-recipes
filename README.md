# odin-recipes
Recipe website created as part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.<br>

This project is to practice using html to create a simple page including images and tags. The page has been styled with basic
css to practice using selectors and properties. The site has not been designed to look good, it is just for practice.
